          <h2>Correlations Discovered:</h2><br>

          <h3>Lacks Healthcare (%) vs. In poverty (%)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows that when there is more people in poverty, more of the
            people lack healthcare.</p>

          <h3>Lacks Healthcare (%) vs. Age (median)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows no clear correlation between the median age on a state
            and the percentage of people that lack healthcare there.</p>

          <h3>Lacks Healthcare (%) vs. Household income (median)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows that the greater the median household income on a
            state, the less people that lack healthcare.</p>


          <h3>Smokes (%) vs. In poverty (%)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows that the greater the percentage of people that smoke,
            therefore the poverty levels on the state are greater.</p>

          <h3>Smokese (%) vs. Age (median)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows that states with younger people (median age) has less
            percentage of smokers in the area.</p>

          <h3>Smokes (%) vs. Household income (median)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows that the greater the percentage of people that smoke,
            therefore less is the median household income in the state.</p>


          <h3>Obese (%) vs. In poverty (%)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows that states with a larger percentage of obese people,
            has larger levels of poverty.</p>

          <h3>Obese (%) vs. Age (median)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows no clear trend that indictes wheter obesity is linked
            with age.</p>

          <h3>Obese (%) vs. Household income (median)</h3>
          <p>The graph that correlates these two variables shows that higher levels of obesity on a state tend to mean
            the median household income is lower.</p>
